-   description: As an Art Historian with a focus on contemporary art my interest always leaned towards communicating artworks and exhibitions in a visual language; say via social media or exhibition design. My experience as a PR & Social Media Editor at Witte de With Center for Contemporary Art in Rotterdam and as a Marketing and Communications Coordinator at Kunstblock in Rotterdam strengthened my ability to translate contemporary art and exhibitions in a modern day visual language that fits the web and social media.
