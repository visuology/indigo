-   description: As an Art Historian with a focus on contemporary art, my interest always leaned towards communicating artworks and exhibitions in a visual language; say via social media or exhibition design. My work experience at several art institutions in Rotterdam strengthened my ability to translate contemporary art and exhibitions in a modern day visual language that fits the web and social media.
